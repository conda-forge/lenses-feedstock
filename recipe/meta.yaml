  summary: A lens library for Python

  # The remaining entries in this section are optional, but recommended.
  description: |
    lenses is a python library that helps you to manipulate large
    data-structures without mutating them. It is inspired by the
    lenses in Haskell, although it's much less principled and the
    api is more suitable for Python.
